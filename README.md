# MonsterBattleJava
Monster battle in Java. Monsters spawn in random locations, they move and fight eachother (not yet). Idea from Derek Banas on Yt.
It does use the library https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi which I'm not including because IntelliJ crashes when i try to push it, i have to figure this out.
